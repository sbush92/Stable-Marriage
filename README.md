# Stable-Marriage
The stable marriage problem is essentially when you have to match up any two lists of things in order of preference to each other. So if you have for example a list of adult males and a list of adult females and you had to figure out how to best match them according to their individual preference to each other you would use the Gale-Shapley algorithm. This algorithm will match pairs until all pairs are stable. A stable pair is when each of the individuals that have been paired up do not have a potential partner that is higher on there preference list that also that same individual higher on their preference list than the person they are already paired to
